# üì¶ Backup My SQLite

Simple Python Script to **Backup** your SQLite3 Database.

This Script probably **works for other filetypes** too, however, it's made for SQLite Databases

Use [`crontab`](https://crontab.guru) for scheduling.

> **Note**: On üí† Windows, there is no Crontab. Here is a [different approach](https://docs.active-directory-wp.com/Usage/How_to_add_a_cron_job_on_Windows/Scheduled_tasks_and_cron_jobs_on_Windows/index.html)

## üìã Flags

`silent` for no output.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Config

Stored in the same directory as the script. It's called `config.yaml`
